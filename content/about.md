## rauta0127 Weblog

Hi, I’m **rauta0127** 👋  
I’m a senior data scientist in the financial industry, and I’m especially interested in **machine learning**, **applied AI**, and building **practical ML systems** (mostly with Python).

This blog is my personal workspace to capture what I’m learning and building — including experiments, notes, and small projects.  
I try to keep things simple, reproducible, and useful.

---

## What you’ll find here
- **ML / AI notes**: things I learned from real-world problems and side experiments  
- **Evaluation & experimentation**: metrics, validation design, failure cases, lessons learned  
- **MLOps & systems**: pipelines, monitoring, reproducibility, tooling  
- **Apps & tools**: small utilities and prototypes I build along the way  
- Sometimes: thoughts on productivity, learning, and the process behind engineering work

## Why I write
I believe writing is one of the best ways to:
- think clearly,
- build things better,
- and share knowledge with the community.

This site also serves as a lightweight portfolio of my work and interests.
