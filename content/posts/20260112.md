## What I’ve read so far

These are my notes from Jike Chong / Yue Cathy Chang’s *How to Lead in Data Science*, up to this point:

- Chapter 1: What makes a successful data scientist?
- Part 1 — THE TECH LEAD: CULTIVATING LEADERSHIP
  - Chapter 2: Capabilities for leading projects
  - Chapter 3: Virtues for leading projects

It’s a pretty thick book, so I’m not fully through it yet—I mostly skimmed to get the big picture first.  
Even with that, I can already tell this is the kind of book I’ll come back to and reread multiple times.

## What makes this book good?

The biggest strength is how clearly it puts common data science struggles into words.  
Reading it, I kept thinking: *“Okay, it’s not just my environment.”* That’s oddly comforting—and it also gives me confidence that what I’ve experienced isn’t “wrong.”

I genuinely think Part 1 (Tech Lead) is worth reading for everyone, not just managers.  
Because “leadership” here isn’t about job titles—it’s about *how you move a project forward and maximize impact*.

## Chapter 1: What makes a successful data scientist?

What stood out to me is that “success” isn’t defined as simply “building accurate models.”

Instead, it’s more about the ability to carry outcomes all the way to real impact:

- framing the right problem
- moving stakeholders
- translating analysis into decision-ready outputs
- making value sustainable over time

The book also emphasizes that leadership isn’t limited to people managers.  
Even as an Individual Contributor (IC), you can demonstrate leadership by aligning people, building consensus, and amplifying impact. That idea really resonated with me.

## Chapter 2: Capabilities for leading projects

This chapter is very practical, and I found myself nodding a lot.

### 1) Turn vague requests into executable plans
Data science projects often start with fuzzy goals.  
A strong Tech Lead can clarify the question, decide what to do (and what *not* to do), and convert ambiguity into a realistic scope and plan.

### 2) Don’t chase a “perfect” technical answer—structure trade-offs and get alignment
Accuracy, interpretability, cost, speed, operational burden… everything is a trade-off.  
A key skill is to organize these trade-offs and align with stakeholders on what to prioritize.

It’s not just about model quality—it’s about designing the decision-making process.

### 3) Manage expectations
Because uncertainty is inherent in data science, expectation management is critical.  
If you don’t make explicit what’s known vs unknown, projects can easily drift or break.

---

## Chapter 3: Virtues for leading projects

If Chapter 2 is about *skills*, Chapter 3 is about *how you show up*.  
It made me feel that if these virtues collapse, projects collapse—no matter how strong the technical skills are.

### Ethics
Data and models can easily cause harm when misused.  
So you need a mindset that prioritizes customers/users and stays honest as reality changes.

### Rigor
Rigor isn’t just statistical correctness. It includes operational responsibility: monitoring, data quality, reproducibility, and maintaining value over time.  
Not “build and forget,” but “own the value.”

### Positivity
Data science comes with constant uncertainty and failure loops.  
Curiosity, persistence, and collaboration really matter in the long run.

## Reflection: I can see my skill gaps more clearly

While reading, I repeatedly thought: *“Wow, I have so many gaps.”*  
But it didn’t feel discouraging. The book helped me recognize those gaps within a structured framework.

Instead of a vague “I’m not good enough,” I can now point to specific areas like:

- expectation setting
- alignment and consensus building
- scope management
- designing with operations in mind
- domain understanding

When gaps are named, it becomes much easier to improve them.

## What hit me in the financial DS context

I work in data science in the financial/banking domain, and this book reminded me of something obvious but important:

> To be effective as a data scientist, you need broad understanding of the business domain.

Even if your modeling skills are strong, it’s hard to create real value without understanding decision points, constraints, and operational realities.  
It also makes stakeholder alignment much harder.

---

## “Data science is teamwork”

One phrase that kept showing up (and stuck with me) was that **data science is teamwork**.

To deliver real value, you need the whole chain to connect:

- business decision-making
- data infrastructure
- model development
- production operations
- monitoring and iteration

There’s a limit to what “individual effort” can do.  
Ultimately, leadership is about *moving people and amplifying outcomes*.

## Summary

My takeaways after finishing Part 1:

- The book articulates common DS struggles so well that you realize “it’s not just me”
- Part 1 (Tech Lead) is useful regardless of title—everyone can benefit
- It works great as a self-audit: it reveals your gaps
- “Teamwork,” “domain understanding,” and “expectation management” hit especially hard for me

Next, I’ll move on to Part 2 (Manager) and keep writing notes in a more “practical and actionable” format.
