Hi, I’m rauta0127.

Welcome to 2026! Since it’s a fresh start, I decided to finally begin a personal blog this year.

I’ve been working in Japan’s data science / machine learning space for a while, and these days I’m in the finance world—mostly involved in ML projects related to credit risk and loan screening.

I’m genuinely into ML/AI, so I’d like to share what I’m learning, things I’m building, and whatever insights I pick up along the way. I also want to try more personal projects this year—small experiments, tools, or anything that sounds fun and useful.

And beyond tech, I’d love to keep some notes about hobbies and life events too. Nothing too serious—just a place to document things and enjoy the process.

My first goal is simply consistency, so I’m going to keep it light and not overthink it. Thanks for stopping by, and if you’re interested, feel free to follow me on X as well!
